                        Hello! My name is Freddy Kristian Putra, a 20-year-old Informatics student currently studying at 
                        Institut Teknologi Nasional Bandung. I have a strong passion for technology and software development, 
                        with a keen interest in learning and applying new programming languages, tools, and methodologies. <br><br>
                        
                        Throughout my academic journey, I have gained solid foundational knowledge in computer science, 
                        including areas such as algorithms, data structures, databases, and software engineering. 
                        I have also worked on various projects that have helped me to hone my skills in coding, problem-solving, and teamwork. <br><br>
                        
                        In addition to my academic pursuits, I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on innovative projects. 
                        I believe that continuous learning and practical experience are key to personal and professional growth in 
                        the ever-evolving field of technology. <br><br>
                        
                        Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I have worked on, and don't hesitate to get in touch if 
                        you'd like to collaborate or discuss technology!
